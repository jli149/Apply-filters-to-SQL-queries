# Apply-filters-to-SQL-queries
As the security analyst of my organization, I recently discovered a potential security incident that  occurred after business hours. To further investigate this issue, I decided to query the  log_in_attempts table using SQL to review after-hours login activity. Additionally, I queried the  employees table to update employee computers as required.
